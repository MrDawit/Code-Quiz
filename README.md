Quiz/Tribute App for Kobe "Bean" Bryant.\
After the quiz starts, a countdown (60 sec) is started. There are five questions that need to be answered (in proper noun form_put some respect on his name!) before the countdown ends. Otherwise, no points are given. Wrong answers decrease the countdown by 5 seconds. Score, time remaining at the end of the quiz and number of correct answers are displayed at the end of the quiz. Score is calculated by time(sec) not used and correct answers. A special dunk is displayed if Score is a 100 or above.
